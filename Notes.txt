- in Selenium projects, you download the jar files (dependencies)

- in Maven, you have POM.XML - where you define all the dependencies (like all the jar files) you need for your projects

- In Protractor projects, there is a concept called package.json

    you give all the dependencies in package.json files

    when you run npm install, then it looks at project.json and go and download all the dependencies

For assertions you need one more framework called chai

For framework we need to mention all the dependencies in package.json file which will then go and install all of them from internet

Command to create a package.json is "npm init"
    You will be asked some questions and you can skip them by hitting enter or you can enter it
    Your package.json will be created
    Now you have to type in the dependencies there

To know what are dependencies that you can include in project.json file, go to their official site
    protractortest.org --> Reference --> Using Typescript
    That will open a sample project in git which will give us all the info
    https://github.com/angular/protractor/tree/5.4.1/exampleTypescript
    
tsconfig.json is also a mandatory file for compiling our code
    To create a tsconfig.json file, type "tsc --init" (do it from Node CMD if you get error)

to run a spec.ts file you can use config.ts file
